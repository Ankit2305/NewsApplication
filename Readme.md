# News Application

This News app is a pseudo-Mobile application developed for Android devices. It provides users with a convenient platform to access and explore a curated list of top-outlinked news articles.

The app fetches news article details from an API and presents them on the home screen. Users can easily browse through the listed articles, which include headlines and URLs, among other variables. When a user clicks on a headline, the app seamlessly loads the corresponding article in a browser window, allowing for a smooth and immersive reading experience.
